[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà / Chinese Version](ANALYTICS_EXAMPLE_CN.md)

## How Google Analytics Tracks Your Game Events

### 1. **Event Flow Example**

When a player pauses the game:

```javascript
// 1. Player presses 'P' key
// 2. Game calls: pauseGame()
// 3. Reducer processes: 'PAUSE_GAME' action
// 4. Analytics tracking: safeTrackGameEvent.gamePause()
// 5. Google Analytics receives:
gtag('event', 'game_pause', {
  event_category: 'game',
  event_label: undefined,
  value: undefined
});
```

### 2. **What Gets Tracked**

#### Game Events:
- **Game Start**: When player starts a new game
- **Game Pause**: When player pauses the game
- **Game Resume**: When player resumes the game
- **Game Over**: When game ends (with score, level, lines)
- **Score Submit**: When player submits score to leaderboard

#### Settings Events:
- **AI Mode Toggle**: When player enables/disables AI
- **Speed Change**: When player adjusts game speed
- **Sound Toggle**: When player turns sound on/off
- **Language Change**: When player switches language

### 3. **Real Example Data**

#### Game Over Event:
```javascript
// When game ends with score 12500, level 5, 23 lines
gtag('event', 'game_over', {
  event_category: 'game',
  event_label: 'score_12500',
  value: 12500
});

gtag('event', 'level_reached', {
  event_category: 'game', 
  event_label: 'level_5',
  value: 5
});

gtag('event', 'lines_cleared', {
  event_category: 'game',
  event_label: 'lines_23', 
  value: 23
});
```

#### Score Submission:
```javascript
// When player submits score 12500
gtag('event', 'score_submit', {
  event_category: 'leaderboard',
  event_label: 'score_12500',
  value: 12500
});
```
